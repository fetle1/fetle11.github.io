<h2 id="jk_about"> About me</h2>
<p>
    I am a public health researcher, data scientist, and educator with a multidisciplinary background that bridges biostatistics, machine learning, and digital health innovation. Currently serving as a Lecturer in the Department of Public Health at the University of Gondar, I bring over four years of academic and applied experience in epidemiology, data analysis, and advanced statistical modeling.
</p>
<p>
    My academic journey includes an MPH in Biostatistics (GPA: 3.88), a BSc in Public Health (GPA: 3.75), and a Certificate in Data Science and AI. Professionally, I’ve gained hands-on experience through roles such as Graduate Assistant, Assistant Lecturer, and Lecturer, as well as internships as a Data Analyst at Spurt! and Data Scientist at Prodigy Infotech.
</p>
</p>
My research focuses on applying machine learning and explainable AI to public health challenges, with particular interests in maternal and child health, cancer prevention, and spatial epidemiology. I’ve co-authored several peer-reviewed publications in high-impact journals, utilizing advanced methodologies such as Bayesian hierarchical models, random forest classifiers, and spatiotemporal cluster analysis.
</p>
</p>
I am proficient in Python, R, Stata, and SPSS, and technically grounded in methods including deep learning, predictive modeling, systematic reviews, meta-analysis, and Bayesian and spatial techniques. I speak Amharic and English fluently, and possess basic proficiency in French and German.
</p>
</p>
Above all, I am passionate about leveraging data to inform equitable health policies and drive impactful public health solutions across Africa and beyond.

<p>
    My research is focused on developing robust, multisensor perception algorithms that enable robots to operate safely over long periods of time and in challenging environments, for example, on road networks, underground, underwater, in space, and on remote planetary surfaces. My goal is to create highly independent autonomous robotic systems for a wide range of tasks, from exploring the surface of Mars to helping with eldercare here on Earth. 
</p>



<p>    
    A central concept in my work is the notion of introspection and internal model maintenance: successful long-term autonomy will require robots to maintain accurate representations both of the external world and of the state of their own sensors and actuators over time. More generally, I am interested in 3D computer vision, probabilistic modeling, estimation theory, and machine learning. I've also recently developed an interest in cloud robotics.
