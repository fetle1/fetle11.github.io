<h2 id="jk_about"> About me</h2>
<p>
    I am a public health researcher, data scientist, and educator with a multidisciplinary background that bridges biostatistics, machine learning, and digital health innovation. Currently serving as a Lecturer in the Department of Public Health at the University of Gondar, I bring over four years of academic and applied experience in epidemiology, data analysis, and advanced statistical modeling.
</p>
<p>
    My academic journey includes an MPH in Biostatistics (GPA: 3.88), a BSc in Public Health (GPA: 3.75), and a Certificate in Data Science and AI. Professionally, I’ve gained hands-on experience through roles such as Graduate Assistant, Assistant Lecturer, and Lecturer, as well as internships as a Data Analyst at Spurt! and Data Scientist at Prodigy Infotech.
</p>
</p>
My research focuses on applying machine learning and explainable AI to public health challenges, with particular interests in maternal and child health, cancer prevention, and spatial epidemiology. I’ve co-authored several peer-reviewed publications in high-impact journals, utilizing advanced methodologies such as Bayesian hierarchical models, random forest classifiers, and spatiotemporal cluster analysis.
</p>
</p>
I am proficient in Python, R, Stata, and SPSS, and technically grounded in methods including deep learning, predictive modeling, systematic reviews, meta-analysis, and Bayesian and spatial techniques. I speak Amharic and English fluently, and possess basic proficiency in French and German.
</p>
</p>
Above all, I am passionate about leveraging data to inform equitable health policies and drive impactful public health solutions across Africa and beyond.

<h2 id="jk_research"> My research</h2>

<!--<div id='jk_twitter'>

</div>{: .align-right}-->

<p>
    My research sits at the intersection of biostatistics, machine learning, and public health, with a strong emphasis on using data-driven approaches to address health disparities and improve healthcare delivery in low- and middle-income countries.
</p>



<p>    
   I specialize in the application of advanced statistical and AI methods—including machine learning, Bayesian analysis, deep learning, and spatiotemporal modeling—to large-scale population health datasets such as DHS, MICS, and health facility data. My work aims to uncover hidden patterns, inform targeted interventions, and support decision-making in maternal and child health, infectious disease control, and health system performance.
</p>

</p>
Key thematic areas of my research include:

Maternal and Child Health Analytics
Predictive modeling of service uptake (e.g., antenatal/postnatal care, skilled birth attendance) using ensemble and tree-based machine learning methods.

Cancer Screening and Prevention
Application of machine learning to identify determinants of cervical cancer screening and guide policy in Sub-Saharan Africa.

Bayesian and Hierarchical Modeling
Use of multilevel mixed-effects models and Bayesian inference to account for clustered data and regional variation in health outcomes.

Spatial and Spatiotemporal Epidemiology
Mapping disease hotspots and trends using GIS and spatial statistics, with a focus on malaria, scabies, and healthcare accessibility.

Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses
Evidence synthesis on adverse drug reactions, disease burden, and behavioral health outcomes, often integrating meta-regression and sensitivity analyses.
</p>

</p>
My recent publications have appeared in journals such as Frontiers in Public Health, BMC Public Health, PLOS ONE, and the International Journal of Gynecological Cancer. Through my research, I strive to translate complex data into actionable insights that advance public health equity and precision health initiatives in Africa.
